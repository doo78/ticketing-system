                        University Helpdesk is created by students, for students. We understand the unique technical challenges that students face because we experience them too. Our mission is to provide peer-to-peer technical support that's approachable, effective, and tailored to the student experience.

                                Our team consists entirely of student volunteers from various disciplines across campus. We're tech enthusiasts who love helping our fellow students overcome technical hurdles. Being students ourselves, we understand the time constraints and unique needs of the university community.

                        What makes our helpdesk unique is that we speak your language. We've sat in the same classrooms, used the same online platforms, and faced the same technical challenges. We're not just solving your tech problems—we're sharing solutions from one student to another.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Our volunteer hours accommodate student schedules, with extended support during midterms and finals. We're accessible through drop-in sessions at our campus locations, direct messaging on the university app, and our student-monitored email system.
